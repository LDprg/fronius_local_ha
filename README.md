# fronius_local_ha
A homassistant add-on for accessing fronius locally

# Compatibility
For newer versions than 0.0.4 you will need a firmware version above 1.36.6-1.
For any firmware lower than 1.34.6-1 us 0.0.4 or lower.
I can't confirm the exact firmware where the latest stops working due to api changes (try to use 0.0.4 if you are in firmware version between 1.36.6-1 and 1.34.6-1 and latest is not working), feel free to open an issue to provide additional information on this topic.
